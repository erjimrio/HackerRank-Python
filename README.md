# HackerRank-Python
practice to strengthen Python fundamentals and improve problem-solving skills through regular coding exercises. 
The focus is on building confidence in Python syntax, control structures, and data handling.

## Structure 
- Solutions are organized by difficulty level (easy, medium, hard).
- Each file corresponds to a specific HackerRank challenge.

## Goals 
- Improve fluency in Python programming.
- Build a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures.
- Document consistent progress in coding practice.

## Disclaimer 
These solutions are part of my personal practice and learning journey. 
They are not official HackerRank solutions and may not represent the only or optimal way to solve each challenge.
The repository is intended to document progress in programming fundamentals.
